# Requirements
## Introduction
Ultrasonic glass for the Blind is the ,simple and effective projects for the blind peoples . Now days the percentage of blindness can be increasing shortly . This glass will definetley helpful to these people .This is simple and low cost product whchi can be low maintenence product compared to the other products.
## Research
Since most of the blind person use glasses and it inspires us for installing the device on
glasses. The ultrasonic sensor is installed on the glasses, but the main unit which including the
minimum system, power supply, and the main switch are placed on a box, and the blind person
can put in his/her pocket. Compare with the device from the University of Oxford, this device
is more practical and easier to use. 
## Defining our project
This device includes a pair of glasses and an obstacle detection module fitted in it in the center, a processing unit, an output device i.e. a beeping component, and a power supply. The Obstacle detection module and the output device is connected to the processing unit. The power supply is used to supply power to the central processing unit. The obstacle detection module basically consists of a ultrasonic sensor, processing unit consist of a control module and the output unit consists of a buzzer. 
The control unit controls the ultrasonic sensors and get the information of the obstacle present in front of the man and processes the information and sends the output through the buzzer accordingly. These Ultrasonic Smart Glasses for Blind people is a portable device, easy to use, light weight, user friendly and cheap in price. These glasses could easily guide the blind people and help them avoid obstacles.

## Features
* It Has an weather assistance it will works in any weathers .
* Audio systems used in this projects will give some clear informations to the users.
__Components Used__
* Atmega328
* HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic) sensor
* Power Supply
* Switches
* Power Supply

## SWOT Analysis
__STRENGTH__
* It work like an alert system for the blind people.
* It is   cheaper than compared to the existing system .
* The audio out available in this project makes the blind people aware of the  opposite objects .
  
__WEAKNESS__
* It gives only the information of the opposite objects only.
* Glasses will be mandatory to wear when ever  they wanted to go.

__OPPURTUNITIES__
*  There will be no need for the dependent to go outside.
*  The updation of the projects will be we have to give some specifications like 360 degree assistance .
*  We also make this glasses for the reading purpose also *Smart Glass For the Blind* with some added specifications.
 
__THREATS__
* The major challenges is There will be an Battery backup .If they go for some long distance then battery backups is concerned .

## 4W'S and 1'H
__WHO__
This will be useful to an the blind peoples.

__WHAT__
The main aim  of this project is to reduce the dependencies of the other people of blind peoples .

__WHEN__
This will be useful to them when they go outside and whenever they need assistance . .

__WHERE__
This will be working in every where .This also works in rainny days and winter also.

__HOW__
The sensor used in this project Ultrasonic sensor which detects the opposite objects and send this information to the microcontroller then it gives the message to the user.
